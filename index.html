			<h4 id="Eniac">Ladies Of Eniac</h4><br>
			<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/ladiesOfEniac.jpg" alt="Picture of Ladies of Eniac" title="Ladies of Eniac"></div>
			<p>
				Comprised of Kay McNulty, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas, Ruth Lichterman,
				Adele Goldstine (and Betty Snyder), these ladies were the first “computors”
				working on ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania’s Moore School of Engineering.
				Bearing the job title of “computor” the ladies were responsible for
				making calculations for tables of firing and bombing trajectories, and to
				determine the correct sequence of steps to complete the calculations for
				each problem and to set up the ENIAC accordingly. (This, by the way, meant
				the women manuevered 3,000 switches and 80 tons of hardware in order to
				program ENIAC by hand). The need to perform the calculations with greater
				speed prompted ENIACs development, hence making these flesh-and-blood
				“computors” obsolete. Adele Goldstine and Betty Jennings were instrumental
				in programming ENIACs stored program, Goldstine was also responsible for
				writing ENIAC’s original technical manual. Through their contributions,
				we gained the first software application and the first programming classes.
				The ladies of ENIAC were inducted into the WITI Hall of Fame in 1997.

			<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/JeanE.jpg" alt="Picture of Jean E. Sammet" title="Jean E. Sammet"></div>
			<p>
				Another woman often (and erroneously) called the first to be awarded a
				Ph.D. in Computer Science (1968, Stanford), Sammet also held a B.A. in
				Mathematics from Mount Holyoke College (1948) and an M.A. in Mathematics
				from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1949). Sammet
				certainly put her mathematics knowledge to use; she was responsible for
				developing the first computer language while working at IBM. Sammet’s
				program, FORMAC, was the first widely used computer language for the
				symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas. Sammet worked at IBM for
				27 years, and was a member of the subcommittee that created COBOL, as well
				as the President of the ACM from 1974-1976. She was also an ACM Fellow
				(1994) and yet another lady on our list to receive the Lovelace Award (1989).

			<h4 id="Allen">Frances Allen</h4>
			<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/FranceAllen.jpg" alt="Picture of France Allen" title="France Allen"></div>
			<p>
				Allen, who earned a B.Sc. degree in mathematics in 1954 (New York State
				College for Teachers) and a M.Sc. in mathematics in 1957 (University of
				Michigan), achieved great progress in the areas of compliers, code
				optimization and parallelization. A Fellow of the IEEE, the ACM and the
				Computer History Museum, Allen did her seminal work at IBM – where she
				became the first IBM Fellow in 1989. Although she worked for IBM for 45
				years, Allen also had a hand in intelligence work via programming languages
				and security codes for the NSA. Inducted into the WITI Hall of Fame in 1997,
				and winning the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award in 2002, Allen was also the first
				woman to win the prestigious Turing Award (aka the “Nobel Prize of computing”) in 2006.

			<h4 id="Holberton">Betty Holberton</h4>
			<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/BettyHolberton.jpg" alt="Picture of Betty Holberton" title="Betty Holberton"></div>
			<p>
				Born Frances Elizabeth Snyder, Betty Holberton attended the University
				of Pennysylvania, where on her first day of classes, she was reportedly
				told by her math professor to quit wasting her time attempting a mathematics
				degree and to stay home and raise children. Holberton instead studied
				journalism, then went on to be hired by the Moore School of Eningeering
				to be one of the first “computors” to work on ENIAC. Apparently her
				professor was wrong, as she became the Chief of the Programming Research
				Branch, Applied Mathematics Laboratory at the David Taylor Model Basin
				in 1959, helped to develop UNIVAC, wrote the first generative programming
				system (SORT/MERGE), and the first statistical analysis package for the
				1950 U.S. Census. Holberton worked with John Mauchly to develop the C-10
				insturctions for BINAC (generally considered to be the origins of modern
				programming languages), and also worked with Grace Hopper in the early
				standards of COBOL and FORTRAN. Not only did Holberton create commands,
				but she was also responsible for developing the numeric keypad and for
				making computers that awful beige color. Holberton was the only woman,
				of the original six ENIAC programmers, to receive the Augusta Ada
				Lovelace Award in 1997.

			<h4 id="Keller">Sister Mary Kenneth Keller</h4>
			<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/SisterMaryKenneth.jpg" alt="Picture of Sister Mary Kenneth Keller" title="Sister Mary Kenneth Keller"></div>
			<p>
				Although Barbara Liskov is often named as the first woman to be awarded
				a Ph.D. in computer science, that honor actually goes to Sister Keller
				who beat Liskov to the punch by three years. After earning her Ph.D from
				the University of Wisconsin in 1965, Sister Keller went on to assist in
				the development of BASIC computer language at Dartmouth – which had
				previously held a “men only” rule. Sister Keller, who also held a BS in
				Mathematics and an MS in Mathematics and Physics from DePaul University,
				felt that women should be involved in computer science (especially in the
				field of information specialist) and has been quoted as saying “We’re
				having an information explosion…and it’s certainly obvious that information
				is of no use unless it’s available.” Also interested in advancements
				toward AI, Sister Keller founded – and directed – the computer science
				department at Clarke College for twenty years.

			<h4 id="Hoover">Erna Schneider Hoover</h4>
			<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/ErnaSchneider.jpg" alt="Picture of Erna Schneider Hoover" title="Erna Schneider Hoover"></div>
			<p>
				Hoover, who earned a Ph.D in the philosophy and foundations of mathematics
				from Yale, began working as a researcher at Bell Laboratories in New
				Jersey in 1954. During her tenure at Bell, Hoover created a computerized
				telephone switching system that used a computer to monitor incoming calls.
				The computer would automatically adjust a call’s acceptance rate, which
				helped eliminate overloading problems. The principles of Hoovers system
				are still in use today; for her achievement, she was awarded one of the
				first software patents ever issued and made the first female supervisor
				of a technical department at Bell.

			<h4 id="Jones">Karen Sparck Jones</h4>
			<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/KarenSparck.jpg" alt="Picture of Karen Sparck Jones" title="Karen Sparck Jones"></div>
			<p>
				Another Brit on our list is Karen Sparck Jones, who is often considered
				a founder of information retrieval. Sparck Jones, who worked at
				Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory from 1974-2002, concentrated her work on
				natural language processing and information retrieval. Her most notable
				contribution was the concept of inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting
				in information retrieval – which is still used in most search engines
				today. Sparck Jones retired in 2002 holding the post of Professor of
				Computers and Information and was also the first woman to receive the
				Lovelace Medal awarded by the British Computer Society.

			<h4 id="Wilson">Sophie Wilson</h4>
			<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/SophieWilson.jpg" alt="Picture of Sophie Wilson" title="Sophie Wilson"></div>
			<p>
				Wilson, a British computer scientist, is most often noted for designing
				the Acorn Microcomputer in the late 70’s. The Acorn Microcomputer, later
				called Acorn System 1, was the first of many systems sold by Acorn Computers.
				However, Wilson wasn’t content to stop there - In 1981, she revamped Acorn
				Atom’s BASIC programming language dialect into Acorn Proton. The Proton,
				another microcomputer, won Acorn an illustrious contract with the BBC.
				In 1983 Wilson contrived the instruction set for one of the very first
				RISC processors, the Acorn RISC Machine, which you know as ARM. Wilson
				also designed Acorn Replay, a video architecture for Acorn machines,
				which contained OS extensions for video access as well as the codecs
				themselves and optimized high frame rate video.

			<h4 id="Meninsky">Carla Meninsky</h4>
			<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/CarlaMC.jpg" alt="Picture of Carla Meninsky" title="Carla Meninsky"></div>
			<p>When Carla Meninsky was hired as a game designer for the Atarti 2600
				console in the early 1980s, she was one of only two female engineers
				working at Atari. The other? Carol Shaw.  While working at Atari, Meninsky
				was responsible for the development of Indy 500 (1977), Star Raiders
				(1979), and Dodge ‘Em, an award winging racing game released in 1980.
				Call of Duty, it was not, but this driving game (which involved
				controlling a race car on a four lane track and collecting dots in order
				to advance through the levels) is a considered a classic from the golden
				era of gaming’s beginning. Meninsky, who also worked on the multiplayer
				Warlords, is now an intellectual property attorney.</p>

				<h4 id="Williams">Roberta Williams</h4>
				<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/RobertaWilliams.jpg" alt="Picture of Roberta Williams" title="Roberta Williams"></div>
				<p>Most famous for her work on the King’s Quest videogame series, a series
					widely considered to be a classic from a golden era of adventure games,
					Williams along with her husband Ken, were big names in graphical adventure
					games in the eighties and nineties. Williams, who developed games for Sierra,
					also leant a heavy hand in other titles like the Colonel’s Bequest,
					Mixed-Up Mother Goose, and “Phantasmagoria” which she has called her favorite.
					A tale of American success and entreprenurialship is there ever was one,
					Roberta was introduced to gaming by her husband, who showed her the Adventure
					game written by Don Woods. To say she liked it is probably an understatement,
					Roberta dove in, realizing that her beloved text adventure games could become
					even better with the by incorporating graphics. Eventually designing a
					game of her own (based on Adventure), called Mystery House, the Williams'
					went on to found On-Line Systems, which became Sierra On-Line (now owned by
					Activision Blizzard) and turned the Williams’ into leading figures in the graphical
					adventure game genre.

				<h4 id="Shaw">Carol Shaw</h4>
				<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/carolShaw.jpg" alt="Picture of Carol Shaw" title="Carol Shaw"></div>
				<p>Said to hold the title and honor of being the first female video game
					designers, Shaw was originally an Atari employee, then later joined
					Activision where she programmed her best known game, River Raid which
					everyone remembers as a "classic"– a scrolling shooter, RR was released
					in 1982 by Activitsion for the Atari 2600. Shaw also brought us 3-D Tic
					Tac Toe (1979) Super Breakout (1978), and Happy Trails (1984). Shaw
					also worked on the widely unknown Polo and the Atari Basic Reference
					Manual. Part of the foundation of gaming, Shaw has games credited to
					her as late as 2006 and was noted for anticipating the industry's
					procedural content generation (by 25 years, ahem) using algorithms to
					create RR's continuous, but non-random, landscape. Done out of necessity,
					the machine at the time provided only 128 bytes (yes, bytes ) of RAM.

				<h4 id="Perlman">Radia Perlman</h4>
				<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/RadiaPerlman.jpg" alt="Picture of Radia Perlman" title="Radia Perlman"></div>
				<p>Often referred to as the Mother of the Internet, Perlman is a software
					designer and network engineer who is most famous for her invention of
					the spanning-tree protocol. Perlman, who developed spanning-tree while
					working for Digital Equipment Corp, holds a Bachelor’s and Master’s in
					Mathematics and a Ph.D in Computer Science from MIT. So, you know,
					girl’s got mad skills. Spanning-tree is a network protocol that ensures
					a loop-free topology for any bridged Ethernet local area network -which
					is fundamental to the operation of network bridges. Perlman is also a
					heavy hitter in other areas – most notably network design and standardization
					such as link-state protocols – including TRILL which she invented to
					correct the failings of spanning-tree. Perlman has also been called a
					pioneer in teaching young children computer programming for developing
					TORTIS, a version of the educational robotics language, LOGO. Currently
					employed by Intel, Perlman holds more than 50 patents from Sun alone,
					and is the author of a textbook on networking, and a co-author of a
					textbook of network security.

				<h4 id="Bartik">Jean Bartik</h4>
				<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/jeanBartik.jpg" alt="Picture of Jean Bartik" title="Erna Schneider Hoover"></div>
				<p>
					Born Betty Jean Jennings, Bartik was one of the more frequently noted
					women working in the infamous ENIAC group. After majoring in mathematics
					at the Northwest Missouri State Teachers College, she was hired by the
					University of Pennsylvania to work for Army Ordnance at Aberdeen Proving
					Ground in 1945. There she met Kay McNulty, and became one of the first
					programmers of ENIAC which at the time was used to calculate ballistics
					trajectories. Bartik also continued working on ENIAC when it became a
					stored program computer. She also worked on both the BINAC and UNIVAC
					I computers. She went on to become an editor for Auerback Publishers,
					and eventually worked for Data Decisions (which was funded by Ziff-Davis
					Publishing) and has a museum in her name at Northwest Missouri State University.

				<h4 id="Hopper">Grace Hopper</h4>
				<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/graceHopper.jpg" alt="Picture of Grace Hopper" title="Grace Hopper"></div>
				<p>
					That’s ADMIRAL Hopper to you, soldier. Admiral Hopper, was not only
					one of the first female programmers, but also the first woman to
					graduate from Yale with a Ph.D in mathematics AND the first woman to
					reach the rank of Admiral in the U.S. Navy. In addition to inventing
					the first computer complier in 1952, Admiral Hopper developed COBOL
					(Common Business-Oriented Language), was credited with popularizing
					the term “bug” and “debugging” – reportedly when she had to remove a
					moth from the inside of a computer, was instrumental in the creation
					of FLOW-MATIC language for the UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II computers and
					was quoted as saying “It is easier to ask forgiveness than it is to
					get permission.” So basically, she’s a bigger bad-ass than you’ll ever be.

				<h4 id="Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</h4>
				<div class="imagepractice"><img src="optimised/AdaLovelace.jpg" alt="Picture of Ada Lovelace" title="Ada Lovelace"></div>
				<p>Aside from having one of the most impressive names ever, Miss Augusta
					Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet
					Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke, herself a mathematician who was
					known as the “princess of parallelograms.” Ada was taught math and
					science lest she succumb to “dangerous poetic tendencies.” Literatures
					loss became technology’s gain when, in 1843 she translated Luigi Menabrea’s
					memoir on Charles Babbage’s analytical engine. Her notes are widely
					considered to be the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine,
					hence making Ada the first computer programmer. The notes, which were a
					thoruough methodology on how to use Babbages Analytical Engine to calculate
					a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, would have run correctly, had the Engine
					itself ever been built. In addition to now having her own day , and her
					own award , her name was also used by the D.O.D. - “Ada” is the name the
					Department of Defense gave to its computer language in 1980. Lovelace is
					famous in geek chic circles to this day - she even has her own tshirt .</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
