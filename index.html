			<h4 id="Eniac">Ladies Of Eniac</h4>

			<p>
				Comprised of Kay McNulty, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas, Ruth Lichterman,
				Adele Goldstine (and Betty Snyder), these ladies were the first “computors”
				working on ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania’s Moore School of Engineering.
				Bearing the job title of “computor” the ladies were responsible for
				making calculations for tables of firing and bombing trajectories, and to
				determine the correct sequence of steps to complete the calculations for
				each problem and to set up the ENIAC accordingly. (This, by the way, meant
				the women manuevered 3,000 switches and 80 tons of hardware in order to
				program ENIAC by hand). The need to perform the calculations with greater
				speed prompted ENIACs development, hence making these flesh-and-blood
				“computors” obsolete. Adele Goldstine and Betty Jennings were instrumental
				in programming ENIACs stored program, Goldstine was also responsible for
				writing ENIAC’s original technical manual. Through their contributions,
				we gained the first software application and the first programming classes.
				The ladies of ENIAC were inducted into the WITI Hall of Fame in 1997.

			<h4 id="Sammet">Jean E. Sammet</h4>
			<img src="optimised/JeanE.jpg" alt="Picture of Jean E. Sammet" title="Jean E. Sammet">
			<p>
				Another woman often (and erroneously) called the first to be awarded a
				Ph.D. in Computer Science (1968, Stanford), Sammet also held a B.A. in
				Mathematics from Mount Holyoke College (1948) and an M.A. in Mathematics
				from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1949). Sammet
				certainly put her mathematics knowledge to use; she was responsible for
				developing the first computer language while working at IBM. Sammet’s
				program, FORMAC, was the first widely used computer language for the
				symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas. Sammet worked at IBM for
				27 years, and was a member of the subcommittee that created COBOL, as well
				as the President of the ACM from 1974-1976. She was also an ACM Fellow
				(1994) and yet another lady on our list to receive the Lovelace Award (1989).

			<h4 id="Allen">Frances Allen</h4>
			<img src="optimised/FranceAllen.jpg" alt="Picture of France Allen" title="France Allen">
			<p>
				Allen, who earned a B.Sc. degree in mathematics in 1954 (New York State
				College for Teachers) and a M.Sc. in mathematics in 1957 (University of
				Michigan), achieved great progress in the areas of compliers, code
				optimization and parallelization. A Fellow of the IEEE, the ACM and the
				Computer History Museum, Allen did her seminal work at IBM – where she
				became the first IBM Fellow in 1989. Although she worked for IBM for 45
				years, Allen also had a hand in intelligence work via programming languages
				and security codes for the NSA. Inducted into the WITI Hall of Fame in 1997,
				and winning the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award in 2002, Allen was also the first
				woman to win the prestigious Turing Award (aka the “Nobel Prize of computing”) in 2006.

			<h4 id="Holberton">Betty Holberton</h4>
			<img src="optimised/BettyHolberton.jpg" alt="Picture of Betty Holberton" title="Betty Holberton">
			<p>
				Born Frances Elizabeth Snyder, Betty Holberton attended the University
				of Pennysylvania, where on her first day of classes, she was reportedly
				told by her math professor to quit wasting her time attempting a mathematics
				degree and to stay home and raise children. Holberton instead studied
				journalism, then went on to be hired by the Moore School of Eningeering
				to be one of the first “computors” to work on ENIAC. Apparently her
				professor was wrong, as she became the Chief of the Programming Research
				Branch, Applied Mathematics Laboratory at the David Taylor Model Basin
				in 1959, helped to develop UNIVAC, wrote the first generative programming
				system (SORT/MERGE), and the first statistical analysis package for the
				1950 U.S. Census. Holberton worked with John Mauchly to develop the C-10
				insturctions for BINAC (generally considered to be the origins of modern
				programming languages), and also worked with Grace Hopper in the early
				standards of COBOL and FORTRAN. Not only did Holberton create commands,
				but she was also responsible for developing the numeric keypad and for
				making computers that awful beige color. Holberton was the only woman,
				of the original six ENIAC programmers, to receive the Augusta Ada
				Lovelace Award in 1997.

			<h4 id="Keller">Sister Mary Kenneth Keller</h4>
			<img src="optimised/SisterMaryKenneth.jpg" alt="Picture of Sister Mary Kenneth Keller" title="Sister Mary Kenneth Keller">
			<p>
				Although Barbara Liskov is often named as the first woman to be awarded
				a Ph.D. in computer science, that honor actually goes to Sister Keller
				who beat Liskov to the punch by three years. After earning her Ph.D from
				the University of Wisconsin in 1965, Sister Keller went on to assist in
				the development of BASIC computer language at Dartmouth – which had
				previously held a “men only” rule. Sister Keller, who also held a BS in
				Mathematics and an MS in Mathematics and Physics from DePaul University,
				felt that women should be involved in computer science (especially in the
				field of information specialist) and has been quoted as saying “We’re
				having an information explosion…and it’s certainly obvious that information
				is of no use unless it’s available.” Also interested in advancements
				toward AI, Sister Keller founded – and directed – the computer science
				department at Clarke College for twenty years.

			<h4 id="Hoover">Erna Schneider Hoover</h4>
			<img src="optimised/ErnaSchneider.jpg" alt="Picture of Erna Schneider Hoover" title="Erna Schneider Hoover">
			<p>
				Hoover, who earned a Ph.D in the philosophy and foundations of mathematics
				from Yale, began working as a researcher at Bell Laboratories in New
				Jersey in 1954. During her tenure at Bell, Hoover created a computerized
				telephone switching system that used a computer to monitor incoming calls.
				The computer would automatically adjust a call’s acceptance rate, which
				helped eliminate overloading problems. The principles of Hoovers system
				are still in use today; for her achievement, she was awarded one of the
				first software patents ever issued and made the first female supervisor
				of a technical department at Bell.

			<h4 id="Jones">Karen Sparck Jones</h4>
			<img src="optimised/KarenSparck.jpg" alt="Picture of Karen Sparck Jones" title="Karen Sparck Jones">
			<p>
				Another Brit on our list is Karen Sparck Jones, who is often considered
				a founder of information retrieval. Sparck Jones, who worked at
				Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory from 1974-2002, concentrated her work on
				natural language processing and information retrieval. Her most notable
				contribution was the concept of inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting
				in information retrieval – which is still used in most search engines
				today. Sparck Jones retired in 2002 holding the post of Professor of
				Computers and Information and was also the first woman to receive the
				Lovelace Medal awarded by the British Computer Society.
			</p>

			<h4 id="Wilson">Sophie Wilson</h4>
			<img src="optimised/SophieWilson.jpg" alt="Picture of Sophie Wilson" title="Sophie Wilson">
			<p>
				Wilson, a British computer scientist, is most often noted for designing
				the Acorn Microcomputer in the late 70’s. The Acorn Microcomputer, later
				called Acorn System 1, was the first of many systems sold by Acorn Computers.
				However, Wilson wasn’t content to stop there - In 1981, she revamped Acorn
				Atom’s BASIC programming language dialect into Acorn Proton. The Proton,
				another microcomputer, won Acorn an illustrious contract with the BBC.
				In 1983 Wilson contrived the instruction set for one of the very first
				RISC processors, the Acorn RISC Machine, which you know as ARM. Wilson
				also designed Acorn Replay, a video architecture for Acorn machines,
				which contained OS extensions for video access as well as the codecs
				themselves and optimized high frame rate video.
